# 0X1A. APPLICATION SERVER

My web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that installed in the first web stack project (Airbnb version2).
While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project,I add this piece to my infrastructure, plug it to the Nginx and make is serve the Airbnb clone project.
